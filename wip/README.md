Anything in this folder should be approached with
extreme caution, a la interacting with a grizzly bear.

## in progress

The file implode-insights.sh is a bespoke script
created for the Insights repo. With it, I'm working
on adding support for ifevals around module include
statements, as well as nested assemblies! o_o;

I hope to take some of the functionality from it
and bring it into the implode-assembly.sh script.

## requirements

You must use Bash 4.x or newer.
If you're on a Mac, you'll need to brew install it
and change your shell. I hope to update this with
better instructions soon.
